# Java-Module-3-Collections-last-char-of-String
As we mentioned in the introduction, we are starting a series of review tasks 
that will allow you to consolidate the knowledge gained so far.

Use the following list to iterate through the for loop:

List<String> companies = new ArrayList<>();
companies.add("DELL");
companies.add("APPLE");
companies.add("SAMSUNG");
companies.add("SONY");
companies.add("ALCATEL");
Using concatenation, write all names after a comma to get the result:

DELL, APPLE, SAMSUNG, SONY, ALCATEL
